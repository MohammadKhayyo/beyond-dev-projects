# 365Scores Selenium Grid Testing Framework

This project provides a Selenium-based testing framework configured to run automated web tests using Selenium Grid. It facilitates running tests across different browsers and platforms in parallel, leveraging the capabilities of Selenium Grid to distribute tests across a network of machines.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Selenium WebDriver
- A Selenium Grid setup or access to a remote Selenium Grid service

## Configuration

The framework comes with a `config.json` file under the `infra` directory, allowing you to specify the Selenium Hub URL, target URLs for different languages, and the browsers you wish to run your tests on.

### Configuration File Structure

```json
{
  "hub": "http://10.0.0.13:4444/wd/hub",
  "url": {
    "hebrew": "https://www.365scores.com/he",
    "english": "https://www.365scores.com/en-uk"
  },
  "grid": true,
  "parallel": true,
  "browser": "chrome",
  "platform": "windows",
  "browser_types": [
    "chrome",
    "firefox",
    "edge"
  ]
}
```

## Setup

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

2. **Configure Selenium Grid**:
   Set up a Selenium Grid environment or obtain access to an existing Selenium Grid hub URL. Update the `hub` value in `config.json` with the URL of your Selenium Grid hub.

3. **Update Configuration**:
   Customize the `config.json` file to match your test requirements, specifying the desired browsers and the base URLs for the tests.

## Running Tests

Tests are structured under the `tests` directory. You can run individual test files using Python's unittest framework.

### Example: Running All Tests

To run all tests in parallel across the configured browsers, execute:

```
python -m unittest discover -s ./tests
```

This command will automatically discover and run all tests within the `tests` directory.

## Structure Overview

- `infra`: Contains core infrastructure setup, including the `BrowserWrapper` for Selenium WebDriver management and `ConfigLoader` for loading the test configuration.
- `logic`: Implements the test logic, including navigation and interaction with web elements.
- `tests`: Contains the test cases designed to be executed against the web application.

## Customizing Tests

To add new tests or extend the framework:

1. **Implement Additional Page Logic**: Add new classes or methods within the `logic` directory to encapsulate interactions with different parts of the web application.
2. **Write New Test Cases**: Create new test files under the `tests` directory, utilizing the infrastructure and logic layers to interact with the web application.
3. **Update Configuration**: If necessary, adjust `config.json` to include new browsers or modify the base URLs.
